				2021-07-16 19:41:08 - tirwyd-sarmes: ~dashus-navnul : One of the coolest parts of the Urbit community is the high level of technical excellence AND knowledge of the humanities. There’s clearly an inherent tension between these two disciplines in the modern world. Humanities so often falls into what Nick Land calls the “perennial critique” of “technology is bad mmkay?” so it’s interesting to see what well-read people are capable of creating when they are wanting to make something technical. I think “productive tensions” is what Urbit does best, and the relationship between “the two cultures” is so obvious at Tlon / Urbit.
The literary roots of Urbit obviously deserves to be it’s own blog post – you interested in writing? ⍨𝖘𝖎𝖙𝖋𝖚𝖑-𝖍𝖆𝖙𝖗𝖊𝖉 🐛 : Lord of Light is a fucking fascinating book. It captures the weird techno-milieu of the 1960's so well. And it's also where the term "accelerationism" first appears in print. The idea that human beings can become gods through technology is fully on display here. Zelazney is definitely not my favorite science fiction author, a lot of his stuff is crap, but this book is excellent.
